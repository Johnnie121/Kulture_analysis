Data analysis project on the Kulture career aspirational change
Kulture Analysis Project

Overview

In today’s evolving work environment, Gen-Z is becoming a dominant part of the global workforce. Businesses are increasingly facing difficulty in attracting, engaging, and retaining Gen-Z employees. This poses a significant business challenge because:
1. Talent Retention Impacts Performance and Profitability
•	High turnover rates among Gen-Z employees lead to increased recruitment and training costs.
•	Losing young, innovative talent also affects continuity and knowledge retention within teams.

2. Employer Branding and Talent Acquisition
•	Companies that fail to meet Gen-Z’s expectations (e.g., flexible work, career development, value-driven work) face reputational risks on platforms like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or X (formerly Twitter).
•	This reduces the quality of applicants they attract.

3. Mismatch Between Job Roles and Aspirations
•	Many Gen-Zs pursue careers that reflect their personal values, creativity, and growth ambitions, yet employers often emphasize job stability, hierarchy, and long-term loyalty.

4. Changing Nature of Work
•	The workplace is transitioning to hybrid/remote models. Gen-Z, as digital natives, expect tech-driven collaboration, autonomy, and transparent communication.
•	Employers who haven’t adapted to this new way of working are perceived as outdated.


📌 Objective
This project explores the growing misalignment between what Gen Z professionals want from their careers and what traditional employers offer. Through case observations, personal experiences, and data-backed reasoning, the project aims to help organizations improve Gen Z recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies.
